        Freewriting is a simple concept. You practice your ability to write and
        think more freely, if you force yourself to write nonstop and ignore the
        little mistakes you - without a doubt - will encounter along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is great practice for both more effective writing processes and
        when you want to work in a state of flow.
      </p>

      <p>This is what this tool is for.</p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        You write - nonstop - for 10 minutes. Just keep your fingers tapping
        away. Try to gently remind yourself not to focus on what you've already
        written. Don't look back. Keep tapping.
      </p>
      <h2>So why this program?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a very simple writing tool to aid you in practicing freewriting.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It automatically counts down from 10 minutes, when you start writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can in no way edit your text. Delete and backspace is disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you pause for more than a second the program will start to delete
          your text. One character at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the time is up your text is locked. And you can copy it, if you
          need keep it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Might sound evil. Might sound silly. Might sound weird. But this is a
        simple framework to guide you through this magnificient writing
        excercise. So you can focus on writing. Nonstop. dig hen til den her
